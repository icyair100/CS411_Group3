Happy Path of UserStory_1 (logging in to Twitter):
User accesses our event web application and logs into their Twitter account. 
A Facebook app request is sent to Twitter and an app token is returned back to our web application. 
The token is used to log in to Twitter and provide authorization for the web application to be use such data that we are scraping. 
The session id is stored in our database and allows the user to gain full access to the client-side of our web page. 


We will be using Firebase integrated with Angular because it allows for an easier use of the same language (javascript) throughout our entire stack. 
It also provides a faster execution speed compared with most other platforms. 
Our group has little experience in Angular and Firebase, but we hope to improve throughout the process. 
Firebase is also better for applications that require real time data, which is more useful than other platforms like Django.
Rather than trying to learn the Django framework from scratch, we decided to invest time improving our Angular skills which we had some experience in.
Due to us only building a basic web application, it would be much simpler to use Firebase which has a database integrated in the platform already. 
Also, it becomes much easier to write code as group in javascript if the backend is integrated with the frontend.
