Geo-location Activity Finder

This software will allow the user to find activities/events that are based on ther personality/things they like(from social media ie. Facebook).
We will also use geo-location and weather information from APIs to find the activities/events in the area that are adaptable to local conditions.
We will login to the user's facebook with OATH to gather information about the user to find personalized activities/events.
We will also use APIs, from eventbright and ticketmaster/stubhub to find additional events. This program will integrate with the user's schedule/availability. The user's availability and social media information will be stored in a database. 






Ingredients to Recipe
The software will allow the user to input ingredients and will output recipes and diet plans that are available to be made from such ingredients. 
We would use a food API that would provide thousands of recipes and a fitness API that chooses a suitable diet plan in relation to ingredients and lifestyle.
We would use Facebook to find a diet suitable to the user's lifestyle in order to give them corresponding recipes.
