Geo-location Activity Finder

This software will allow the user to find activities/events that are based on ther personality/things they like(from social media). We will also use geo-location and weather information to find the activities/events in the area that are adaptable to local conditions. We will login to the user's facebook with OATH to gather information about the user to find personalized activities/events. We will also use APIs, from eventbright and ticketmaster/stubhub to find additional events.
