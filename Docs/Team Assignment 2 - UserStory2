As a user, I can either manually type in my location or authorize googlemaps to find my location
The user should be able to manually type in their location for us to find events in their area.
If everything goes according to plan, then the location information should be stored and checked with the ticketmaster and stubhub api. It would then output a list of events in their area.
If the user is unable to manually type in their location or does not know what their location is, they can allow googlemaps to locate where they are and search for events around their area.
