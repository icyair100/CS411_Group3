As a user, I can personally select my interests
If the software misses any of the userâ€™s personal interests, the user should be able to add to their personal information, which will be logged to the database. 
If everything goes according to plan, then the personal information should be stored in the database. 
If the user cannot add their own interests, then there will be an option to select from a list of prewritten categories.
