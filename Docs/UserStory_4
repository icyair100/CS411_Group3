As a user, I can select how many events are displayed

The user is given the option to submit a request to display the x amount of events. The x amount of events will be the ones that are most popular in their area.
If everything goes right, a chart will be displayed under the ticketmaster and stubhub headers. Within the chart would be event header names and the url to purchase the tickets.
If the user does not submit a request for an x number of events, 2 events would be automatically displayed with their location.
