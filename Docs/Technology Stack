AngularJS:
We are using AngularJS, which is an open-source Front end Javascript framework. 
It makes it easy to incorporate a MVC model onto browser-based application and allows for less coding of javascript to get the web page working. 
Angular helps take advantage of existing protocols by taking lines of javascript that talk to the server and retreives data to talk to the web page (aka Models).
Angular allows for e2e testing so the code can be tested and the developer can observe the behavior of the code.
It helps create single-page applications easily in HTML. The ability to use the MVC model allows for less coding and integration issues. 
The data binding in Angular allows a sync between the Model and View, thus making improving code efficiency. 
Due to these reasons, we chose Angular; it becomes easier to develop our application through the MVC model method.
