As a user, I can view the url of the ticket:

The program should pull up a list of locations/events that the user has interest in.
The user should be able to access them and select the event to purchase a ticket by entering the ticketmaster or stubhub main page.
However, the program may have a problem reaching the api of ticketmaster and stubhub if the servers go down.
Therefore, a solution would be to display the name of the event besides the url pages and then allow the user to search the event on other vendors.
